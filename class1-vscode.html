        <h1>Welcome to Python! üêç</h1>
        <p>Let's get you familiar with some basic tools and terms to make your journey smooth.</p>

        <h2>1. VSCode (Visual Studio Code):</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>A fancy editor where you can write and organize your Python code. It's like Microsoft Word, but for code!</p>
        <h3>Why use it? </h3>
        <p>It highlights your code, checks for mistakes, and even suggests improvements! Plus, it has a built-in terminal (we'll get to that).</p>
        

        <h2>2. Terminal (or Command Line):</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p> A place where you can type commands for your computer to execute. It's like talking directly to your computer!
        </p>
        <h3>Why use it?</h3>
        <p> Running Python scripts, installing cool Python tools, and many more activities are done here.</p>
        <h3>Quick Commands:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cd : Like telling your computer, "Go to this place!"</li>
                <li>ls or dir: Asking your computer, "What's here?"</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Directory:</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Another name for a folder on your computer. Just like a folder where you store your school papers, a directory stores computer files.</p>
        <h3>Why use it?</h3>
        <p> Your Python scripts (the .py files) live inside directories. Knowing where they are helps you tell the computer which one to run.</p>
        

        <h2>4. .py Files:</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>This is where your Python code lives. The .py is like a label saying, "Hey, I'm a Python file!"</p>
        <h3>How to run it?</h3>
        <p>In the terminal, you type python my_file.py (replace my_file.py with your file's name) and watch the magic happen!</p>

       

        <h2>5. .txt Files:</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>A place where you can store plain text, like notes or a diary. It's not Python code but Python can read and write to these.</p>
        <h3>Why use them with Python?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, your Python script might need to read some info (like a list of names) or save some info (like high scores in a game)</p>
        

        <h2>Quick Activity:</h2>
        <p>Open VSCode: Play around! Start a new .py file. Maybe type print("Hello, World!") and run it.
            Explore the Terminal: Try the cd and ls (or dir) commands. See what happens!</p>

        <p>If you are interested in customizing your vscode, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvXHM2NByh4" target="_blank">link</a> to help you get started.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>That's it for today! üåüNext time, we'll dive into actual Python coding. But for now, experiment with what you've learned and have fun!</p>
